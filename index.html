        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Wendy Solis. I am a Political Science and International Affairs Major at the University of California Riverside. I am a first generation college student who will be graduating in May of 2023. I started a internship in the Undocumented Student Programs (USP) at UCR in September of 2021 and have been working there ever since. For this internship I am under the supervision of Ana Coria who is the Director of Undocumented Student Programs. My current title is Conference Coordinator and the project Iâ€™m currently working on is about discovering how entrepreneurship is and how it works for undocumented immigrants. I am taking a focus on entrepreneurship as a college student because of the environment I happen to live in. I have had previous experiences as workshop presenter but this will be the first time I will be taking the lead as the Head Coordinator of the entire event. 
<br><br>

I previously worked with the California Immigrant Youth Justice Alliance  (CIYJA) from April 2020 to July 2020. I was under a COVID Response Fellowship which meant that all the fellows in the program would be responsible for finding a way to educate the public about COVID-19 and providing resources for the community. This could come in the format of flyers, social media posts, or informational presentations. We collaborated with statewide organizations that were led by youth. The collaborations would be fundraisers, rallies, or vigils that brought awareness to the struggle of detainees in detention centers during a pandemic. This experience brought unity within our leaders and members. The pandemic is a very sensitive topic for many of us to talk about because some of us have lost dear family members during this time. But because it is a serious issue some communities are under the shadows and not receiving the proper medical attention they need which is as fellows we have the responsibility to make these issues known and spread to raise awareness that there is a lot of work needed to be done for our unseen community members. 

<br><br>


I recently decided to part ways with an organization I was a founding member of. I was part of a  youth led organization called IE Migrant Abolitionist. We were a small group of students who decided it was time to focus on educating the future leaders who would be walking in our footsteps not too long from now. We created presentations and events that attracted the youth and brought them out to learn about all the movements that happened in the Inland Empire as well as in the entire state of California. We happen to live in one of the states with the greatest number of immigrants. The diverse population we are surrounded by has brought in many future leaders into our programs and allowed us to spread our missions with other youth who want to make a change. I was the Social Media Manager for this organization and it was a key role because it helped reach audiences that would be willing to learn and immerse themselves in the topics we talked about. I was in that position from July 2020 to August 2021. It was a place where I learned about graphic design and how advertising works in the era were how well you know technology matters. It was also the place where I learned the most about leadership and that it takes more than just influencing people but also having plans of action when situations don't go the way we expected them to go. 

<br><br>



I grew in my career as well as a person in all these experiences. I hope that one day I will be able to apply all the skills I have learned through these experiences to a career of my choice. I happen to be very involved in local issues but as an advance through my education I realize that there are bigger issues that need to be addressed that could be potential solutions or a prevention to the problems my local community faces. This is a reason why Iâ€™m also studying International Relations in hopes to be able to participate in the solution to many of these problems.
